This repository contains LDraw 3D models of the Fx Track system elements. These model files can be used with any LDraw compatible CAD application or generate high quality renders for instructions and illustrations.

## Installation

The contents of the `ldraw` folder can be copied into your LDraw installation folder's `Unofficial/parts` folder.

For example, for Bricksmith users on macOS, add the Fx Bricks LDraw parts as follows:

```shell
    $ git clone https://github.com/fx-bricks/fx-track-ldraw.git
    $ cd pfx-ldraw-models
    $ cp -R ldraw/* /Applications/Bricksmith/ldraw/Unofficial/parts
```

Make sure to reload/re-index the parts library in any tool that uses your LDraw installation.

## Usage

 These LDraw models can be used in a variety of LDraw compatible CAD software for producing composite models, instructions, documentation, etc.  The  models have been generated from raw CAD data with simplifications made to reduce the complexity of the resulting meshed objects.  Therefore, the dimensional data implied in these models does not necessarily reflect the actual physical configuration of the real Fx Track product.
